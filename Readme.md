INTRODUCTION<br/>
This project is for CS510 Intro to Web Development Spring 2022.<br/>
The purpose of this project is to create a professional website that includes a Navbar and About, Previous Work, Projects, and Contact sections or pages to demonstrate what we learned in class. I chose to make individual pages for Index, About, Previous Work, Projects, and Contact pages and I used JavaScript for the Navbar. I exclusively used Javascript, CSS, and HTML for my website. Both Javascript and CSS were used for styling. Javascript was used for events/interactivity. Theme colors are shades of blue and highlight color is pink. More information on how the website is built can be found in the journal submitted to Canvas for this class.
<br/>
HOW TO RUN THE CODE<br/>
You can use your browser to open the HTML files. All necessary Javascript and CSS files are already linked to HTML files, and all pages are linked through the navbar. I only checked the website on Chrome and Firefox browsers, and for screen sizes at 414px, 768px, and 1024px.
