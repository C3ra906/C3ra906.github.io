        <h2 class="text" id="hello">Hello, my name is Cera Oh</h2>
        <p class="text" id="intro">
          I am a masterâ€™s student in Computer Science at Portland State
          University. My area of focus is artificial intelligence and machine
          learning, but I enjoy learning about many different areas of computer
          science, such as computer security. I currently work as an of counsel
          patent attorney for a Seattle-based law firm in Washington and
          collaborate with other attorneys on patent prosecution matters in
          Portland, Oregon. I am licensed to practice law in Oregon, and I am a
          registered patent attorney with the United States Patent and Trademark
          Office. I received my J.D. degree from Lewis & Clark Law School in
          Portland, Oregon in 2015 and a B.S. in Biology from University of
          California, Los Angeles in 2011. Obtaining the M.S. in Computer
          Science will expand my technical understanding of inventions involving
          complex algorithms and cutting-edge technologies. In the future, I
          would like to be involved in projects involving artificial
          intelligence or machine learning as a programmer or legal counsel.

          In my free time, I enjoy exploring the food and music scenes in
          Portland and watching movies at home with my husband and my cat Meeko.
