        <p class="text" id="hello">Hello, my name is Cera Oh</p>
        <p class="text" id="intro">
          I am a masterâ€™s student in Computer Science at Portland State
          University. My area of focus is artificial intelligence and machine
          learning, but I enjoy learning about many different areas of computer
          science, such as computer security. I currently work as a patent
          attorney for a Seattle-based law firm, and collaborate with other
          attorneys on patent prosecution matters in Portland. I am licensed to
          practice law in Oregon, and am a registered patent attorney with the
          United States Patent and Trademark Office. I received my J.D. degree
          from Lewis & Clark Law School in Portland, Oregon in 2015 and a B.S.
          in Biology from University of California, Los Angeles in 2011.
          Obtaining the M.S. in Computer Science will expand my technical
          nderstanding of inventions involving complex algorithms and
          cutting-edge technologies. In the future, I would like to be involved
          in projects involving artificial intelligence or machine learning, as
          a programmer or as legal counsel.
        </p>
        <p class="text" id="free">
          In my free time, I enjoy exploring the food and music scenes in
          Portland and watching movies at home with my husband and my cat Meeko.
