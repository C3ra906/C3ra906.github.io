        <h3>Machine Learning Project - Logistic Regression</h3>
        <p class="description1">
          As a final group project for CS545 Machine Learning class, my
          groupmates and I implemented and trained two machine learning models
          to make predictions on stroke occurrences based on 10 potentially
          predictive features and a label indicating whether the patient has
          ever had a stroke. The 10 potentially predictive features are gender,
          age, history of hypertension, history of heart disease, marriage
          status, employment type, residence type, average glucose level, BMI,
          and smoking status. The dataset we used is found hereLinks to an
          external site. The data set had a total of 5,110 patient records. The
          purpose of the project was to implement and compare two different
          models of machine learning algorithms. The two models we chose were
          multilayer perceptron and logistic regression. I wrote the main code
          for logistic regression and feel it would be appropriate to share for
          the personal website. My code was written in Python language. The
          dataset was very biased towards non-stroke patients, so we
          experimented with oversampling and undersampling the data to compare
          the results
