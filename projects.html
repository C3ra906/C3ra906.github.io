          I have not be involved in many projects yet as I am new to the field,
          but hope to be more involved in the future as I learn more. Here are
          some of my assignments from Computer Science classes at Portland State
          University.

            Machine Learning Project - Logistic Regression
          </h3>
          <p class="description" id="description1">
            As a final group project for CS545 Machine Learning class, my
            groupmates and I implemented and trained two machine learning models
            to make predictions on stroke occurrences based on 10 potentially
            predictive features and a label indicating whether the patient has
            ever had a stroke. The 10 potentially predictive features are
            gender, age, history of hypertension, history of heart disease,
            marriage status, employment type, residence type, average glucose
            level, BMI, and smoking status. The dataset we used is found
            hereLinks to an external site. The data set had a total of 5,110
            patient records. The purpose of the project was to implement and
            compare two different models of machine learning algorithms. The two
            models we chose were multilayer perceptron and logistic regression.
            I wrote the main code for logistic regression and feel it would be
            appropriate to share for the personal website. My code was written
            in Python language. The dataset was very biased towards non-stroke
            patients, so we experimented with oversampling and undersampling the
            data to compare the results
